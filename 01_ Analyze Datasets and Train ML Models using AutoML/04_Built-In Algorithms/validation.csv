__label__1 "i love a good gaucho/ culotte . these are very comfortable and fit is tts ( i 'm 5 ' 9 145 and wear a 29 ) . they are ironed with a line down the front which i do n't like as it 's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight . the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice . since they 're linen they will require frequent ironing ( which i hate to do in the summer ) ."
__label__0 "love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online however it falls a little short once in person . it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines did n't make it appear as a swing dress highlighting your figure . i wish this could have worked however it felt a little too unshapely ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger . but it 's basically cut for model-sized people only . it 's short and wide and if you have any boobs at all it 'll make the back pucker . i ca n't imagine this will look good on most women ."
__label__-1 "i own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance . i was hoping these would be the same . i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front . i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric it is tacky !"

__label__0 "usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me ! and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work . i 'm a 34d and it was way too small in the chest area . it is a beautiful shirt though and i 'm very sad that i have to return it . it will work better on someone else for sure . so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine !"
__label__1 "i tried this in the black and white in the store . the material is very thin . you can not wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery . the arm holes are cut very inconsistently . some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit . others are cut fine . i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right . this does fit snuggly but is more flattering that way ."
__label__-1 "according to the label this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned . i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered . it looks like there 's a drawstring running through every seam . so disappointed in the quality and the labeling . awful ! i gave it one extra star because it 's cute ."
__label__0 "this top is cute but i found issues with both the fit and the quality . i tried on an xs but found it to be boxy on my petite frame ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs 34a ) . even worse though was the feel of this shirt . it 's not lined so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin . it was so itchy and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room . it 's a pretty shirt but not worth actually wearing ."
__label__1 "i fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it . it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it did n't matter . i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days . this is one of my new favorites !"

__label__0 "in the photo this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing . i am 5 ' 7 always take a size medium but on me the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just did n't fit properly . the collar does n't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly . if you try to use the button it stretches and looks terrible . in the back it falls short . it 's going back ."

__label__1 "this top is beautiful and special . the burnout velvet ( so nice and soft ) the flowers the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful . i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top ( hip area ) than i was expecting but not snug . i will wear this during the holidays and beyond ! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it !"

__label__1 "i tried this top on with a pair of white shorts half tucked and it looked really classy and nice . the fit was loose but flattering it is a tiny bit sheer but i was wearing a magenta bra so perhaps i am biased . overall i think this is a good basic addition to a summer wardrobe can be worn with a nice skirt or with jeans as shown here . the 0 ( or xs ca n't remember ) fit me at 115 lbs with 30dd chest ."
__label__1 "this is really a gorgeous blouse . the design is very feminine and elegant and fits true to size . i did n't think it ran short and the material is light and airy . it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second . it was def . worth the wait . a gorgeous top ."

__label__0 "the cotton the print and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful i ordered right away ! but there are some discrepancies . the shoulders have a puff to them that i do n't notice on the model and that does n't flatter athletic shoulders . the buttons are ( cheap ) difficult to button . the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else it 's nearly empire on me . and there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo . because the dress is tig"
__label__0 "i received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews . normally i would just exchange but i do n't know if it 's worth getting another broken one ."
__label__-1 "as much as i wanted to love this top it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am ( i 'm a size 6 ) . maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference ."
__label__0 "the snake and the studs they make the dress . sadly the snake is hard to find as mentioned in another review . this dress also runs large i 'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too . two pics show a small fitted look and the other two show a full swing look . i 'm trying to make this work but it may have to go ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt it 's easy to belt . i just wish it was tighter ."
__label__-1 "contrary to the first review there is a zipper so while it was n't easy to get on it did fit over my bust . i found this too small and high waisted and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso . what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo . it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering . the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l"
__label__1 "i fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it . unfort they were out of the s so i went with a medium . fortunately for me this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large i will still keep it . the material is sturdy and of good quality the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy . great piece !"
__label__1 "this is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer . great paired with jeans or white denim . runs large and is a true tunic length . very pretty fabric and built in camisole too . only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in the pink color . the fit was fine but i did n't care for how thin it was . there is lining which i suppose is there to combat the thinness but it 's only in certain places . the lining should have been all over . maybe if i had gotten this in blue it would n't have been so bad ."
__label__-1 "retailer has incredible service and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it . however this dress can not be cleaned . i saw a stain on it after the first use so i first tried hand washing it . however the black part of the dress came off on the white part making the stain worse . i then tried dry cleaning it ( the care tag allows both ) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white . it 's a beautiful striking dress ( that would be great maternit"
__label__0 "this was very tight in the bust in my typical size . it fit more or less everywhere else but the material has no give . so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress this will be a hard dress to wear . the color is really lovely though !"
__label__0 "i loved this dress and was hoping to keep it . but for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy . i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips ."
__label__1 "this is just a fantastic dress ! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove . i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps : ) i took the regular length and found it perfect . the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower . i 'm only 51 but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me definitely a keeper !"
__label__0 "this is a cute dress but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on . i ca n't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it . especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle ."
__label__1 "these joggers are gorgeous -- you can even dress them up ! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking . the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering . really i knew the minute i saw them i would love them . but i do have to say that the lovely model wearing them -- -the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag ( i bought that too ! ! ! ) and that big smile sold me ! . many thanks to retailer -- personal stylists carolyn and blair . always so helpfu"

__label__-1 "i loved these pants and purchased them in three colors . like another reviewer within a few weeks having worn them no more than a couple of times the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes . i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them . so disappointing as i really did love the pants . total waste of money ."

__label__0 "a pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while . had to return it ."
__label__1 "this chemise is very pretty in person . when i tried it on i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise . the material is kind of thin but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it it wo n't show . it looked super cute with a denim jacket on . i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly ( for reference i am 5 ' 2 34b 120lbs ) . i am very happy with this purchase and i ca n't wear it as a chemise a coverup or a hot day sundress . highly recommended !"
__label__1 "i love this dress i love the style i love the pattern i love the feel of the fabric . there 's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me . however i think it runs a little large particularly because it 's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature and it 's a great one : this dress ( and your figure ) needs it . i am 135 pounds 5 ' 5 and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should 've known to try a small but i went with my usual size in dresses"
__label__1 "i have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season . i did n't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out . please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return etc . i love this so much !"
__label__1 "i am not really a fan of jumpsuits/rompers/etc . but i love this jumpsuit . very good quality and design . fits well but i thought the 4 was pretty large for a 4. i mean i probably should have gotten a 2 ( which was sold out ) but i do n't usually have to get a 4 tailored . i did in this case but it was still worth it ."
__label__-1 "i loved fabric print and back detail . design however was a little too boxy to be flattering on me . even at great price i sent it back ."

__label__1 "comfortable flattering one step up in formality from jammies what more could you want ?"
__label__1 "this top is a very comfortable very easy top to wear . it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about . i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine . the ruffle lays really well down the front which i was concerned about because of how busty i am . i ordered a small and it fits just right . i think the knit back really helps with that . very nice !"
__label__1 "this skirt makes me look at least a size smaller . i love it ! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top . tts- got my usual 10 in green ."
__label__0 "i followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down . however the jacket was still too large . it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge . also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy . it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall so i bought it a size smaller than normal but it fits so i could say it runs a little big . very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture ! i 'm more top heavy and it kind of camouflaged that which is always great !"
__label__1 "i ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color ! looks great with my blonde hair . the bell sleeves which are all the rage right now add to the feminine look . i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look !"
__label__0 "i love this dress but it is too short to keep . i am 5 ' 8 and weigh 124lbs . most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer . it looks adorable on but it is just too short ( about 3 inches above my knees ) to be considered professional enough to wear to work ."
__label__1 "absolutely in love with this dress ! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout . i 'm a 34b 27 waist and 36 hip and 5 ' 3 and went with the xsp . very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price ."
__label__1 "i love the cold shoulder trend ! this sweater is not bulky but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish ! it is not your typical sweater . if you want something unique but still basic this is your sweater . looks great with jeans and khakis ."
__label__-1 "i bought a petite medium and the length was right but it fit like a potato sack . it was quite comfortable and did n't look completely terrible from the front but from the side it was terribly unflattering . when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie . i do n't do form-fitting clothing but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way . it 's got to go back ."
__label__0 "i wanted to own this so badly ! it ran really short even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders . i could barely get the dress off !"
__label__-1 "i have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april . finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar . i checked the instructions and it says cold water wash. so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled ! ! ! looks like the popsicles are melting ! i 'm so sad because this dress is adorable ! i 'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one . should be dry clean only !"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this in the mail and so disappointed when i put it on . it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up but i do n't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams ? i do n't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area . returned it the next day ."
__label__0 "this top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy . however if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute . i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough . i wish that it had worked because it is so unique ."

__label__0 "i likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit . my bra showed . i am about a d cup smallish in other proportions ( 125 5 ' 6 ) and no bra worked with this so that i would n't have to worry about my bra showing . nice fabric and drape . maybe good for someone who does n't need a bra ?"
__label__0 "disappointed in the quality of the dress . love the style and especially the colors . the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made . the top bodice is more substantial . not worth the price tag of $ 148.00 . dress does run short ."
__label__0 "just a warning . i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on . if you do n't have a super tiny upper waist this wo n't fit well . too bad because it 's super cute if a bit sheer ."
__label__-1 "i am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes ! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips ... but for those of us with curves ( i 'm a size 12 hourglass ) these are very unflattering . they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds just around the hips ! so bummed because they look so cute on the model ."
__label__0 "loved this top but had to return it . the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality"
__label__-1 "beware . white is not white . white is more cream off-white light beige . i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color . they are cute but not white . i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer but unfortunately creamy colored shorts do n't do much for navy/white tops.also the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok ."
__label__1 "i love the print of this dress ; the deep blue really is striking . i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore it 's hard to justify the price . i ca n't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering . still on the fence . . . it would be better as a sale piece ."
__label__0 "snags very very easily . i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged ! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top lovely color and beautifully detailed ! i 'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back ."
__label__-1 "this is not even a dolman style sweater because it 's loose fitting everywhere around the arm . the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm but this is not the case with this sweater . it 's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve ."
__label__-1 "this top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace . it would be a great top to use as loungewear though ."

__label__1 "it is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day"
__label__-1 "the sweater runs large the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy . i would never be able to wear it out of the house . however the material is exceptionally soft and delightful . keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater but way over priced for this purpose . if you can get the fabric to lay correctly you 're a genius ."
__label__1 "these pants are great . i am 5 ' 6 and 133lbs . i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms . medium fits well except knee pit area . maybe because they are not very stretching fabric . however they are still flattering . the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines ."

__label__0 "i got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress . it was not well made at all ! the lining did n't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places . i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need ! the fabric itself is very nice but just not well made . i do not recommend this dress ."
__label__0 "i normally get a small in this style shirt but it did n't fit at all so i had to send it back . too bad"

__label__-1 "not a coat by any means merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining -- -and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on . the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and is n't pretty enough for a spring coat .. sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated ."

__label__0 "this dress looks so beautiful on the model and i could n't resist ordering it on-line . i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight . i 'm 5 ' 5 ' and 135 lbs . i was very disappointed when i put on . it 's made for a curvy build . the dress was just too big especially around the hips . i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build !"
__label__0 "i bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is . this is a warm and cozy sweater more bulky than oversized . pattern has a comic book-style art look . it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist . cute warm sweater for winter -- wore with an undershirt ."
__label__0 "overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots did n't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad ! ! ! )"

__label__1 "this top is really cute . the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it . the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top . i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders but it does n't . very cute . the armholes are cut on the bigger side but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything . ( just comfortable ) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming . runs pretty tts . i ordered my usual medium and it 's not quite as form fitting"

__label__1 "so simple to throw on with jeans or you could dress it up . the ruffles give it a little extra flair . nice and soft really comfy . i have n't decided which size i am going to hold onto . i ordered in a small and a medium . small fits me great and i am usually a pretty standard medium . i think it just depends on what look you are going for . wish they had it in a lighter color like an ivory or pink . i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade ."
__label__0 "this is a very lightweight comfy sweater jacket . i wanted to love but did n't find it special enough for the price . i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy . the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front . that look was lost on the medium though the general fit was better . in the end the looked medium too sloppy for my taste and the small felt too small ."

__label__-1 "the neck is so big on this sweater i could n't make it lay right . the shape of the sweater is odd . it is really wide on the upper torso but tapers near your waist . it did not look as depicted on the model . the sweater is a lovely color i liked the two-tone but overall the fit was too weird for me . material is soft and it felt really nice on but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck ."
__label__0 "the shirt is nice but not as nice a material as i was hoping but i kept it anyway . but after washing it it is even more disappointing not very soft and now kind of an odd length . hopefully it will grow on me but would n't recommend it especially for the price ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to like this coat so bad ! i loved the bright red color and design but when i received it it seemed very cheap and just too large . i returned it ."
__label__0 "like others reviewers mentioned on here this dress is extremely well made . but there were too many cons for me as well . this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame but for tall busty and curvier girls it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately . the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out . however i 'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top . there was entirel"
__label__-1 "i rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever . but this dress is awful . i ordered the black and white . the fabric is very poor quality . the colors are washed out . i almost did n't try it on but i did and found that for me the fit was terrible ( though some of the reviewer pictures are cute ) ."
__label__0 "i saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it . i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived i tried it on ( or tried to try it on ) and it did n't fit some parts of my bday ( mainly in the bust ) . i ordered the largest size so there was no where to go from there except to send it back . others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area ( i.e . too much material ) . i never got to find out because i really could n't get the dress"
__label__0 "very high quality dress . there are two layers ( the under navy and over white crochet ) which makes this worth the price . however it is very straight making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs . tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs ."
__label__-1 ".... that 's what i look like wearing this dress . a sad sad sack . the fabric is less than ideal and there is no shape to speak of . i love that it has pockets but that 's about it . there was just way too much fabric for a petite person . this dress has got to be good on someone sadly that person was not me ."
__label__0 "my firned tried this on and her first comment was take it off it is scratchy so i did n't bother trying it on . it is however beautiful if you are not sensitive to scratchy material . fit was true to size ."
__label__0 "this is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it . it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy but unfortunately it did n't work for me . i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else . so perhaps this works better for the smaller chested . additionally and this was n't so much of a con and just something to note the fabric is pretty see-through . it works for the"
__label__1 "now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done . there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points : great fit flattering silhouette comfortable fabric shape enhancing cut and the easiest casual style ever ! i got the 10p and my body is 5 ' 3 140 # 36dd"
__label__1 "lightweight and casual i picked this jacket up on sale . i usually do n't like sale items aggressively priced- there is usually a reason why it was a difficult sell to begin with but this was a pleasant surprise- as in no surprise ! picture depicts color and material well . great throw-on for running errands . clean lines nice simple detail . only thing that is slightly annoying is that the off-center zipper makes the wider side flap over when not zipped but this is true with almost any top cut th"
__label__1 "although i find $ 150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater buy it . i bought a size medium which fits me exactly . it is an off-white which is what i wanted . i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt for the sweater dress look . it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater . comfortable and flattering . great for going out causal and staying warm !"
__label__-1 "the fabric felt cheap and i did n't find it to be a flattering top . for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40 ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i could n't for a few reasons i thought i 'd share : the color is bright orange . it is not softer like peach in the picture . it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear . i thought 'd be more swingy but it was more structured . very pretty and good quality tho ."
__label__1 "this top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size . love the back detailing . and it is really good t-shirt quality ."
__label__-1 "after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale . i 'm tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures . firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together . if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it . this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines . i also found the blue black"
__label__1 "when i tried on this dress my husband 's jaw dropped to the ground . it is so unique and so beautiful on . however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed . i am a size 6 5 ' 8 and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section . my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen . buy this !"
__label__-1 "long-time ag jeans fan . lately though i 'm finding the material is much too stretchy . i wanted a good pair of jeans . if i wanted pajama jeans i would 've ordered them . i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered ( same review there ) . so back both pairs went . it 's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted . if only they had been made out of actual jeans material ."
__label__1 "several reviews have stated this dress is embroidered with a popsicles . it is not embroidered but an attractive popsicle print . i usually wear a 2p and after reading review ordered an 8p . a bit roomy in waist but with tie at waist it works . length great but arm holes large . will have altered as this fit/flare shirtwaist dress is so flattering ."
__label__-1 "this was so boxy and unflattering . i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag . was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit . sizing down would not help this one . went back !"
