-1,"I wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference  i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to",Blouses
-1,I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.,Blouses
-1,The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it,Blouses
-1,"This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference  i am 5""4  115 pounds  and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.",Blouses
-1,This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front  and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.,Blouses
-1,I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.,Blouses
-1,I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen  in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover  the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.  overpriced  to boot.  obviously  mine is a minority opinion.,Blouses
-1,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.,Blouses
-1,The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.,Blouses
0,"I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful  and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well  which is not a given for this style top  and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions  and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length  not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4""  120 lbs and tried a size s.",Blouses
0,The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty  but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest  it was very unflattering.,Blouses
0,Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!,Blouses
0,I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully  the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also  there were a lot of thread h,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful aesthetically  and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out  so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.  however  i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me  which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt  which looked nice. however  the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s,Blouses
0,I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.,Blouses
0,The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.,Blouses
0,Based on previous reviews  i sized up to size 4 - i typically wear xs or s. while the length was okay  the body was way too wide! the neck was almost like a mock neck & higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me! overall  i didn't find it flattering or anything special.,Blouses
0,This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r,Blouses
1,I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very  very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit  it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!,Blouses
1,Nice rendition of a summer halter that resembles denim. i bought my normal small but could have downsized to an xs. if your busty stay with your normal size as it is more tts. i like the blue plaid colors and the soft cotton material it's made of. it has a very nice flow with the cute peek a boo back neckline. the interior fabric lining is also a quite lovely chambray blue that nicely offsets the blue plaid.,Blouses
1,I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large  i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy  but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!,Blouses
1,"I tried the 4 and felt it ran a bit big  i'm 34a-28-26  5'6"" about 130lbs and expected to take a 6. the 4 was ideal.  love the concept but thought the material was too stiff to be a 'swing' tank. the pleats in the back poke up when you move or bend as if you've got little horns coming out of your back. i think a chambray  like cloth and stone produces might have rendered this super cute design better (imo).  it has a trapeze shape  i wouldn't plan on tucking it in.  finally  you mightn't want to",Blouses
1,I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist  but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one  the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses  but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou,Blouses
1,I bought this in the store and love it. seeing it online - i would never think to buy it. much more flattering in person!,Blouses
1,I love this tank! its something you can dress up with a skirt  or wear over jeans. i like loose fitting tops  although i have a slender frame. this is also so comfortable. i went with a size medium  and it fits perfect.,Blouses
1,"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this  i bought a small. (i'm 34a  ~125 lbs  5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans  the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'",Blouses
1,I tried this on a whim last week even though it was a bit above my budget  and i couldn't resist taking it home. the photo doesn't do the textured sheen of the silk justice--the metallic tones of the flowers are really vibrant  but still subtle. my husband (who usually hates anything with a bow) loves this  though i have been tying the bow a bit lower than shown on the model. go one size down--i usually wear a 14 in blouses but took a 12 in this.,Blouses
-1,I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss,Dresses
-1,I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.,Dresses
-1,This dress was a disappointment. not black  but brown. and it was very oddly made  with a weird  seam right across the belly. on its way back...,Dresses
-1,I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first  it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.,Dresses
-1,I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.,Dresses
-1,I'm 5 feet 120 and hourglass figure. i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package. i ordered my usual small petite. the dress is so short and small you would have to be 4 feet 90 pounds. returning.,Dresses
-1,The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.,Dresses
-1,I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable  easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry  it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.,Dresses
-1,Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it  however it just did not fit.,Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing  but the arm holes are huge! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didn't work.,Dresses
0,The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely  and in general  it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price  very disappointed.,Dresses
0,I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed,Dresses
0,"I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite  but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated  and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31"" from the shoulder seam to the hem  not 36"" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely  but i just can't",Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress!! i eyed it for months before deciding to purchase  and when i hit submit  i purchased a size down  given the prior reviews. excitedly  i whiled away the moments until it appeared in my mailbox. as soon as this dress was delivered  i ripped it out of its packaging and ooohed and aaahed over the beautiful lace overlay and the halter cut. hurriedly  i pulled the dress over my head  allowing it to drape over my body. and drape it did  but not in a good way; rather  the d,Dresses
0,I loved the colors on this dress  but i don't like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders  but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape,Dresses
0,So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!,Dresses
0,The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.,Dresses
0,I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however  it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed  as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one  maybe two sizes.,Dresses
1,The dress is  very feminine and very flirty. i love orange/melon-colored dresses. this one does not disappoint. it does run extremely small around the rib cage. i had to size up to a 6 when i typically wear a 2 or 4. my bra size is 32 b. nice quality fabric  lined  with built-in bustier.,Dresses
1,This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement  i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!,Dresses
1,"I love this dress. the pattern is fun  the style is relaxed and breezy for spring/summer  and it is well-made. a steal at the sale price! also  it has pockets :) a huge plus for me. since it is a loose-fitting style  i would say it run just a tad big. i bought the s petite and i am 5'4"" 115lbs. i could've gone xs petite ...but the s fits well and looks great. the pattern is stunning. a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant  but it hits me right",Dresses
1,"Wow  i didn't think this dress would work on my curvy frame. i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumu's on me. this was so flattering  the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee. i am 5.6"" and 145lbs for reference. the weight its light/cottony and it looks great with flats and wedges.   love it!",Dresses
1,I was so excited to receive this dress! it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail. it's very pretty on. that being said  i ordered a size 4 which fit me perfectly (150 lbs) but ladies  i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion  my arms are out of shape. not toned and flabby. the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice. it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve. so keep that in consideration if,Dresses
1,Bought this for a summer wedding  it fit great and i got a lot of compliments!,Dresses
1,The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile  you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well  perfect for texas winters!!,Dresses
1,Love everything about this dress...cut  color  material and price!,Dresses
1,"I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model  but if i was to tighten it  it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite)  and it looked huge  when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work  it was a lot of fabric  and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall  so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look  this is great. i would  however  order eptite for 5'1.5"".

-1,I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.,Fine gauge
-1,"I didn't mind the ""scratchiness"" others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front  but uncomfortable.",Fine gauge
-1,Did not work for me. material was a bit thin  poor quality  the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.,Fine gauge
-1,Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,Fine gauge

-1,"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9""  so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect. i loved the",Fine gauge
-1,I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor,Fine gauge
-1,I wanted to love this. however  the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.,Fine gauge
-1,It's beautiful  lovely quality  gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium  which is what i got  it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately,Fine gauge
0,"I am about 5'6""  135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small  as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging  i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped  but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up  my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine  skimming but not tight",Fine gauge

0,I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy,Fine gauge
0,I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape,Fine gauge
0,This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.,Fine gauge
0,It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.,Fine gauge
0,I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me  this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me  especially at this price point.,Fine gauge

1,Beautiful sweater. i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy. the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls. nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings. love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight.,Fine gauge
1,This is the ideal easy-breezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy  cozy  but still stylish. i love it.,Fine gauge
1,Super soft  cozy cardigan! i have a long torso and this is just the right length to cover my behind! i wish retailer would carry more sweaters with this shape. the sweater is soft and light - perfect for every day and you could wear it year round  although with its lighter weight  it might not be as perfect for winter. i purchased this in the kelly green color and it's gorgeous. i have it on right now!,Fine gauge
1,In the quest to find comfy  cute  casual tops i took a change on this one. it's cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn't suit my coloring or body type   but i still recommend because it's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else's closet.,Fine gauge
1,This top looks just like you see it on the website - design is super cool and color is awesome  almost acid washed in areas. but know that this top is super  super thin and will not provide any warmth. i wish it were a bit thicker in fabric  it would have been perfect for the cool fall and going into winter especially for the price. the medium in this one fit me better than the small. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.,Fine gauge

1,This is a beautiful and super soft cashmere sweater. i found it to run large  so thankfully i ordered one size down  which was perfect. i'm normally xs  but the xxs was very flattering  still loose and casual  but fitted in the waist and arms. it is longer in length and hit mid to lower hip on my petite frame. the regular was fine  but a petite would probably be great. the sleeves are nice and long and have a pretty lace stitch detail. the cowl is nice  not too overwhelming. this is so soft and,Fine gauge

-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates

0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates

0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates

0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates

-1,A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.,Jackets

1,The collar from a distance looks like it has seen better days (very scruffy)  but it is so silky soft. and the slight sheen to the jacket is a nice twist to an ordinary army type. the fabric is definitely thinner than i expected  but it&#39;s also softer and better for layering.,Jackets

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly  but is more flattering that way.,Layering

-1,Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size  but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought  better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well  literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam,Pants
-1,I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact  two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however  as we were looking at the items  we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality  as the previous reviewer noted. therefore  none of us purchased the pants.    the staff at the store were very helpful,Pants
-1,"I am 5'6""  130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed.",Pants
-1,I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.  problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).  problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other,Pants

0,This jumpsuit is gorgeous...on the right body. if you have a tiny rib cage and a flat stomach and an average to short torso  this may fit you beautifully. on me  the defined gathered area you see in the photo was very tight and hit me in an odd place. the fabric is a great weight and it is a beautiful and rich looking. i really wanted this to work out for me. as for size  i found it just a little tight in the hips  waist and rib cage.,Pants
0,I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however  the fit was off. the waist was too high  the length too short  and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately  i decided to return.,Pants

0,"I am 5'2"" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste.",Pants
0,I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason  this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.,Pants

1,I love these pilcro pants. i had them in two colors  both beige and khaki. super comfy  and they stretch out a little around the waist with wearing. however  i recently ruined both sets in the wash because i used a stain-stick remover to try to get some grease spots out of them. the stain stick instead lifted the dye off of them! now i have two sets of pants with odd light splotches on them...so sad they aren't more color-fast :(,Pants
-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts
-1,Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.,Shorts
-1,These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color  but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.,Shorts
-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,Shorts

0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,Shorts
0,I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.,Shorts
0,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,Shorts
0,I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.,Shorts

0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts

-1,As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,Skirts
-1,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,Skirts
-1,While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must.

-1,Well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.,Skirts
-1,This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist  tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts  but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.,Skirts
-1,I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite  however  i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing  but on me  i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly  this is going back.,Skirts
-1,Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,Skirts
-1,This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.,Skirts
0,I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple  nothing too flashy or fancy  that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:  __________________  pros:  - fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim  you could probably size down.  - exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow,Skirts
0,Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.,Skirts
0,This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.,Skirts

0,Love everything about this skirt but the sizing. i'm a size 6/medium in almost everything but this skirt swallowed me. i wise there was a small or even extra small to try out. i'm also 5'5 and the skirt was right at my knees. definitely size down if you want it to look like the pictures.,Skirts
0,This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery  yet subtle  and it's a nice sturdy cotton  not flimsy and cheap looking. however  i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts  but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin  this might be great for you.,Skirts
0,I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.,Skirts

1,This skirt is much more vivid in person  which i like. the fit though was off for me. i ordered my usual size medium. i wear a 6 or 8 in bottoms. the medium was fitted!! you could see every curve. definitely not comfortable with that! i would probably have a better fit with a size up  however  i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt... so i think i will pass on this one.,Skirts

-1,After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo  from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what,Sleep

-1,Ordered the biggest size available  the large. the arms are so tight  i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms  either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.,Sleep
-1,These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.,Sleep
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.,Sleep
-1,Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,Sleep
-1,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,Sleep

1,I loved the idea of these pants as i've been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants. i wear 26 in most of my jeans. i'm not super skinny & consider my legs medium (not too skinny & not too athletic). i tried these on in xs (36 european as marked on them) & they were big around the waist & hip area. there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy! i did however liked the length. the fabric is nice & heavy which i also loved. sadly  these didn't work for me though. really wish t,Trend
1,Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.,Trend
